# Data Visualization and Reproducible Research

The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find visualizations produced using the [Statlog heart disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(heart)). Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the USA  [(CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/healthprotection/ncd/cardiovascular-diseases.html) and globally  [(WHO)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1). 

The visualizations are:

- *Number of Heart Disease Positive/Negative Patients by Age and Gender*
- *Fraction of Heart Disease Positive and Negative Patients & Total Patients by Age Group*
- *Heart Disease and Patients by Age and Maximum Heart Rate*

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored pesticide use in Florida and, again, the Statlog heart disease dataset. 

The visualizations are: 

- [2015 Pesticide Use in U.S. Agriculture](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/pesticide-use)
  -  *2015 Estimated Pesticide Use by Florida County* (an interactive plot)
  - *2015 Estimated Pesticide Use by Florida County* (a spatial visualization)
- [Statlog heart disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubamsumbria/statlog-heart-data-set)
  - *Estimated impact of 13 factors on predicting heart disease* (coefficients of a linear model)

Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

**Sample data visualization:**

Note: This map probably indicates the density of farmland in Florida counties. An interesting extension would be to normalize the results by farmland acreage.


## Project 03

In this project, I explored the compressive strength of concrete. Concrete is the most important material in **civil engineering**. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of _age_ and _ingredients_. The dataset used here is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

The visualizations are: 

- Concrete Compressive Strength versus Age
- Concrete strength versus Cement content, age, and aggregate content


**Sample data visualization:**

### Moving Forward

A key takeaway from this class and project is that designing a chart can be a long process and require many iterations, tools, and internet searches. While I do not have much occasion to produce visualizations at work, at a minimum, I anticipate using the skills learned in this class in my free-time and for my own curiosity.
